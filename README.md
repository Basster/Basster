### Hi there, I'm Ole ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer, coach and consultant at @teamneusta.

- I've been doing @symfony projects since 2009 (Version 1.4), so I'd call myself a Symfony Enthusiast.
- I'm trying to spread my experience by giving talks at various meetups, usergroups and conferences. See my [talks](https://github.com/Basster/talks) repository for details.
- Beside PHP and Symfony I'm heavily interested in DevOps stuff, like @kubernetes, @docker and @traefik.
